1. [Easy] Given a string S, remove the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' from it, and return the new string. Example 1: Input: "leetcodeisacommunityforcoders" Output: "ltcdscmmntyfrcdrs" Example 2: Input: "aeiou" Output: ""

2. [Easy] Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order. Example 1: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]. Example 2: Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 Output: [1,2] Example 3: Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 Output: [0,1]

3. [Easy] Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0. A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only. Example 1: Input: s = "Hello World" Output: 5 Example 2: Input: s = " " Output: 0

4. [Easy] Check if a given string is a palindrome. Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. A palindrome is a word or sentence that’s spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

5. [Easy] Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.

6. [Easy] Running Sum of 1d Array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

7. [Easy] (1528) Shuffle String
   Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

8. [Easy] 1512. Number of Good Pairs
   Given an array of integers nums.

A pair (i,j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

Return the number of good pairs.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.

9. [Easy] 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
   Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

Example 1:

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

10. [Easy] 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
    Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation:
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

11. [Easy] 1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings

Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

Example 1:

Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
